It is the world\u2019s oldest board game; yet still arguably the most sophisticated and challenging one. In many ways, this game is a living reflection of Chinese culture, philosophy, strategic thinking, and operational art.\n\nMost sports and games find their origins in human conflict. They turn deadly human confrontations into regulated competitions. The Olympic Games are prime examples. Weiqi is no exception.\nOnce created, sports and games also become part of culture. Culture influences human thinking and behavior in many ways. American football, for instance, finds its expressions in U.S. national security decision-making, diplomatic interactions, and above all, military undertakings. Weiqi as a Chinese cultural artifact is intrinsically connected to Sun Tzu\u2019s Art of War and the Chinese way of war.\n\nThe presentation on Weiqi, Sun Tzu, and the Chinese Way of War will highlight the fundamentals of the Chinese strategic culture, Sun Tzu\u2019s Art of War, and uses Weiqi to illustrate the Chinese way of strategic thinking and operational art.\n\nDR. DAVID LAI\n\nDr. David Lai is a Research Professor of Asian Security Affairs at the Strategic Studies Institute (SSI) of the U.S. Army War College (USAWC).

I do so by bringing a social justice perspective to the study of ICT and society. \n\nAccording to Adams, Bell and Griffin (1997), social justice education utilizes experiential pedagogical principles that help students to understand power relations expressed in oppressive systems that incite feelings of marginalization, exploitation of labor, threats of violence, cultural imperialism, and feelings of powerlessness. As students apply these themes to familiar ICTs and their digital culture, they become conscious of their operating worldview and are able to examine alternative ways of understanding the world and social relations. \n\nSocial justice education has the potential to prepare students to become something more than technologists who are able to effectively design, implement and manage information systems. They are becoming people who are sophisticated in their understanding of social interactions amongst diverse groups, and are able to critique current technology arrangements and envision new possibilities for ICT and society.\n\nABOUT LYNETTE KVASNY\n\nLynette Kvasny, associate professor of Information Sciences and Technology, received her Ph.D. in Computer Information Systems from the Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University. Her research focuses on how and why historically underserved groups appropriate information and communication technologies.\n\nLynette Kvasny is creative and tireless in her selection and integration of real world examples of information and communication technology into her teaching activities. In courses ranging from freshman seminars to doctoral research foundations, she guides her students to recognize and articulate how technologies that they often take for granted are having powerful effects on individuals, social groups, organizations and cultures."}, {"end": "2013-08-25", "title": "College Dean's Meeting", "start": "2013-08-25", "location": "IST Builiding, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802", "id": 11, "desc": "This meeting is for first year students admitted either summer or fall, juniors who transferred into the College of IST from other majors, colleges, or campuses, and all new international and exchange students.\n\nInformation will be provided regarding college-specific student program and service opportunities.

Animation is a perfect test bed for informal interfaces, because it is a powerful expressive medium, but current animation tools are either too restrictive or too complex. K-Sketch is a \u201ckinetic\u201d sketch pad for informal animation that allows users to create simple animations quickly and easily with sketching and hand gestures. To design K-Sketch, I analyzed 72 usage scenarios with a novel conceptual modeling technique called interface optimization. In this talk, I will present the K-Sketch interface and explain how interface optimization was used during the design process. I will also describe laboratory studies that show significant improvements over existing tools, show how K-Sketch is being used by both educators and designers, and explain how it is being extended to support prototyping of more polished animations and video games.\n \nBio:\nRichard Davis is an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at Singapore Management University specializing in Human-Computer Interaction.
